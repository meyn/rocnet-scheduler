The RoCNet scheduler framework includes a scheduling server that controls the
scheduling of tests on the various hosts / gateways that are being monitored.
The hosts being monitored should be running the scheduler agent with a list of
supported tests configured on them.

This was developed as part of the RoCNet project - https://tta-portal.misc.kth.se/rocnet

Please refer to the README's within the 'roc_agent' and 'roc_server'
sub-directories for more details on configuring and running the scheduler agent
and server.
